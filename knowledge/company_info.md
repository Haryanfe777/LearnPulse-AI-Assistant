# LearnPulse AI Company Information

## Mission
LearnPulse AI empowers learners to build coding skills through activity-based practice—using guided challenges to understand programming concepts like loops, conditionals, debugging, and functions.

## Core Pedagogy: Activity-Based Learning
- **Learning by Doing:** Learners complete short, structured activities that map to coding constructs (e.g., sequencing, branching, repetition).
- **Multi-Sensory:** Combines visual feedback, audio cues, and interactive steps to reinforce concepts.
- **Gamification:** Progressive challenges with real-time feedback, badges, and streaks to maintain motivation.
- **Inclusive Design:** Supports diverse learning preferences with adjustable pacing and scaffolding.

## Key Metrics Explained
- **Interaction Accuracy (0-100%):** How precisely learners complete required activity steps. Lower accuracy may indicate confusion, unclear instructions, or setup issues.
- **Success Rate (0-100%):** Percentage of challenge attempts completed successfully. Reflects comprehension of the coding concept.
- **Score (0-100):** Weighted combination of success_rate (70%) and interaction_accuracy (30%).
- **Streak Days:** Consecutive days of activity—a key engagement indicator.
- **Concept Mastery:** Performance across four core areas:
  - **Loops:** Repetition and iteration
  - **Conditionals:** If-then logic
  - **Debugging:** Error identification and correction
  - **Functions:** Reusable code blocks

## Platform Features
- **Adaptive Difficulty:** Challenges adjust based on learner performance.
- **Peer Comparison:** Anonymous ranking within classes (optional, instructor-controlled).
- **Instructor Dashboard:** Real-time progress tracking, alerts for struggling learners, and individualized feedback suggestions.
- **Bilingual Support:** Full French and English interfaces.

## Getting Started (Instructors)
1. **Create Your Class:** Add learners individually or import from CSV.
2. **Assign Challenges:** Start with beginner-level challenges; let learners progress at their own pace.
3. **Monitor Progress:** Check weekly dashboards; use this AI assistant for summaries and insights.
4. **Provide Feedback:** Use individualized feedback suggestions to guide each learner.
5. **Celebrate Wins:** Highlight high scores, streaks, and concept mastery publicly (with learner permission).

## Research Backing
LearnPulse AI is grounded in research on constructionist learning (Papert, 1980), deliberate practice, and mastery-based progression. Studies show that structured practice with timely feedback improves retention and conceptual understanding in STEM subjects.
